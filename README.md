# Meme Mayhem

This is the new and improved version of Meme Mayhem, now being rebuilt in Odin and Raylib for higher performance, cleaner code, and full mod support.

# FAQ

* Will this have mod support?
→ Yes! Mod support is planned from day one, powered by the shared Engine library.

* How will the game improve?
→ With Odin’s compiled performance and Raylib’s lightweight rendering, we can now support Much larger worlds, even more **chaotic** gameplay and way **more than 15 players at once**

* Why remake it?
→ The old Python version became too big to maintain efficiently. This rewrite ensures cleaner code, faster updates, and long-term stability.

# Building
